## Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
This study applies Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MEDIRL) to autonomous driving, focusing on the car-following scenario. The primary objective is to extract the driver's reward function from a dataset of expert demonstrations. A deep neural network is trained on the observed expert trajectories to approximate the expert's reward function, capitalizing on their ability to represent complex, nonlinear interdependencies of state features.
